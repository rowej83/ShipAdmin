Shipment Estimator

Takes two inputs, a column of part #s and a column of quantities, and displays detailed and summarized shipment related info.

The DB stores the case pack, weight, and pallet type info for each of the part numbers. The site will take this info and show total weight/quantities/cases as well as estimated total pallets and  estimated total pallet spaces on a truck.
